## Design choices

### DAtabase choice

I will choose MySQL database as it is offering spatial features needed in task 3. The data presented by the task will be easily modeled by relational model so the database is good fit for the presented requirements.

### Database first approach to db

I will not use code first approach. It's always better to have your base modelled by some kind of DDL. The app will be easier to maintain and it will be easier to create db docker containers separated from DB. Also it gives me all tools that db is providing me.
